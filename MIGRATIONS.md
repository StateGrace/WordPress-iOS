# Core Data migrations

This file documents changes in the data model. Please explain any changes to the
data model as well as any custom migrations.

## WordPress 33 (@koke 2015-06-12)

Changes to the data model:

- `Account` loses the `isWpcom` attribute. Only WordPress.com accounts are stored in Core Data now
- `Blog.account` is now optional
- `Account` loses the `xmlrpc` attribute, as they will all be the same WordPress.com XML-RPC endpoint.
- Self hosted username is stored in `Blog.username` now, and it's no longer transient.
- Removed `isJetpack` attribute
- Added `isHostedAtWPcom` attribute

Migration details:

- Only `Account` objects where `isWpcom == YES` will be migrated, added a predicate filter to the mapping model
- `Blog` has a custom migration policy to calculate `isHostedAtWPcom` and `username`
